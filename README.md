# FISHPACK-CMake

This repository is a fork of UCAR's [FISHPACK Fortran 77 library 4.1](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/legacy/fishpack) with added CMake support. All changes are non-breaking and users can still build FISHPACK with the original Makefiles.

For more information and installation using the original Makefiles, see [README_FISHPACK4.1](doc/README_FISHPACK4.1).


## Build instructions

### Prerequisites
The following software are required to build FISHPACK-CMake from source:

- Linux or macOS
- Intel or GNU Fortran compiler
- [CMake](https://git-scm.com/) version 3.0, or above
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (_Optional_ if cloning)


### Download

Clone or download FISHPACK-CMake from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/dmey/fishpack-cmake.

### Build and tests

Go into `fishpack-cmake` and run the following commands from your command-line interface:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_REAL8=ON -DTESTS=ON ..
make # Creates shared and dynamic library
ctest # Run tests
```

## Support
